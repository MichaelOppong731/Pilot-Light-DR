# üõ°Ô∏è AWS Pilot-Light Disaster Recovery Architecture

This project demonstrates a **Disaster Recovery (DR) solution** using the **Pilot-Light strategy** on AWS. The core idea is to maintain a minimal version of the production environment in a **secondary region**, and quickly scale up in case of a disaster or failure in the primary region.

---

## üìå Architecture Overview

![DR Architecture Diagram](./disaster-recovery.png)

- **Active Region**: Hosts the full production environment.
  - EC2 instances behind an Auto Scaling Group
  - Amazon RDS (primary)
  - Amazon S3 (with cross-region replication)
  - Lambda functions
  - VPC with public/private subnets
- **Passive Region**: Hosts a minimal setup (Pilot Light)
  - EC2 instances (scaled-down or stopped)
  - Amazon RDS Read Replica (cross-region)
  - Lambda function (inactive unless failover)
  - Same VPC layout as primary region

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Failover Works

Failover is **automated** using the following components:

- **CloudWatch Alarms** monitor the health of the primary site (e.g., EC2 instance status, HTTP health checks).
- **Route 53** health checks detect regional failures and automatically shift traffic to the secondary region.
- **SNS Topic** triggers a **Lambda function** when CloudWatch detects a failure.
- The **Lambda function**:
  - Promotes the **RDS read replica** in the passive region to a **primary**.
  - Scales up the **EC2 Auto Scaling Group** in the passive region using the AWS SDK (Boto3 or SDK for Node.js).

## üíª Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

This entire setup is automated using **Terraform** with a **modular approach**.

## Project Structure

- terraform/
  - modules/
    - vpc/
    - sg/
    - secrets/
    - ec2/
    - rds/
    - s3/
    - lambda/
  - primary/
    - main.tf
    - variables.tf
    - outputs.tf
  - secondary/
    - main.tf
    - variables.tf
    - outputs.tf



- **Modules** are reusable for both primary and secondary regions.
- **Primary region** hosts the full stack.
- **Secondary region** hosts a pilot-light stack (minimal resources).

## üîÅ Lambda Function Details

- **Trigger**: SNS Topic ‚Üí Triggered by CloudWatch alarm.
- **Action**:
  - Promotes RDS Read Replica to primary using AWS SDK.
  - Scales up EC2 instances by modifying the Auto Scaling Group desired capacity.
- **Region**: Deployed in the passive region but inactive until triggered.
- **Environment Config**: Uses AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store to manage values cross-region.

## üåê Sample Application

- A simple web application was deployed on EC2 instances behind a Load Balancer.
- Verified to switch correctly between regions using Route 53 failover policy.

---

## ‚úÖ Testing the DR Plan

To simulate a failure:

1. Terminate EC2 instances in the **primary region** or manually disable health checks.
2. Observe:
   - Route 53 switches traffic to **secondary region**.
   - Lambda promotes the RDS replica and scales EC2.
3. Application becomes available in the passive region.
4. Once primary is restored, DNS can be pointed back manually or through automation.
